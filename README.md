* A survey application using **Express.JS** to determine the personality of a person based on the book "La Sabiduria del Eneagrama".
* Users can be introduced manually (one by one) or automatically using an **API** (many) and **Chance.JS** based on the preferences.
* It can also show an OLAP cube with the data merged from the databases using **Pivot4J**. The OLAP cube must be created using **Schema Workbench**.
* All the survey data is stored in various databases using a **MySQL-cluster (Docker)**.
* All the user data is stored in a **MongoDB database**.
